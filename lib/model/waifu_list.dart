Unlike other keyhole tops, hers has a collar that goes up higher and covers a good portion of her neck. It also has a similar back hole showing her shoulder blades. Hers is also very cropped, short enough that it ends just beneath her breasts and leaves a large section of her stomach and back uncovered.

She controls Denji through the promise of a romantic and sexual relationship while also threatening him with extermination if he disobeys her. Ruthless and normally dispassionate, she will do whatever it takes to reach her goals, even at the cost of the people she should be protecting.\nMakima is an extreme fan of Chainsaw Man, the 'Hero of Hell'. Fascinated by its ability to wipe out the embodied concept of a devil through consuming them, her stated goal is to bring Chainsaw Man under her control in order to use its abilities to create an ideal world without fear, death, and “bad” movies. However, failure is also acceptable, as it would mean being eaten—an honor according to her.\nMakima's true goal, however, was to be together forever with Pochita and lead a happy life with him. She always yearned for something like a family, being incapable of forming equal and meaningful relationships as the Control Devil."
